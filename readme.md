# READ ME for Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Purpose
In this project we had to make a responsive website that was well organized when 
viewed on various screen sizes. It tested our ability to use bootstrap and our understanding
of responsive layouts as a whole.

## Review
I originally had an issue with how the bootstrap components interacted with CSS. 
I was leaning too hard on cards as opposed to creating the layout myself. 
Eventually I figured out that using too many components can hinder your progress. 
The only issue that I could not figure out was changing the nav bar to stack on top
of one another when the screen size was extra small. My tutor had me eliminate the 
column I had on the navbar entirely, so I wasn't sure how to proceed.

### Summary
All in all, this homework was much harder than I had anticipated. Although I played with the
format for an extremely long time so that probably had something to do with it.
I definitley learned alot about bootstrap!
